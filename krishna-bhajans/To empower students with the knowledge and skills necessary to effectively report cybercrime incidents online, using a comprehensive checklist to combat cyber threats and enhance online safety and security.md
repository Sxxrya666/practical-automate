**Cybercrime reporting** is a critical component of cybersecurity and law enforcement efforts to combat online threats, such as phishing, financial fraud, identity theft, and unauthorized access. A structured approach to reporting ensures that incidents are documented accurately, evidence is preserved, and authorities can take appropriate action. A comprehensive checklist for reporting cybercrimes includes:

1. **Document Incident Details**:

   - Record the type of cybercrime (e.g., phishing, malware, data breach), date and time of occurrence, and a detailed description of the incident.

2. **Preserve Evidence**:

   - Use digital tools to collect screenshots, logs, emails, or forensic images that document the cybercrime.

3. **Identify Reporting Channels**:

   - Determine the appropriate platform or authority based on the cybercrime type (e.g., national cybercrime portals, fraud reporting platforms, or international agencies).

4. **Submit Report**:

   - Follow platform-specific procedures to provide detailed information and upload evidence.

5. **Track and Follow Up**:
   - Monitor the complaint status and provide additional information if requested by authorities.

Effective reporting enhances online safety, supports investigations, and contributes to the prosecution of cybercriminals.

  - Report spam within 3 days for prompt action.
  - Provide details like sender number, message content, and timestamp.
- **Verification**:
  - Confirm submission by noting the complaint tracking number.

### 5. Track the Complaint

- **Action**:
  - Use the tracking number to monitor complaint status on the respective platform.
  - Check for updates or requests for additional information.

### 6. Follow Up

- **Action**:
  - Respond promptly to any inquiries from authorities.
  - Provide supplementary evidence or clarifications as needed.

### Comparison of Reporting Platforms

  - Captured evidence using Snagit (screenshots of the email) and FTK Imager (forensic image of email client data).
  - Reported the incident via the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, uploading evidence and receiving a tracking number.
  - Reported a fraudulent SMS via the Sanchar Saathi 'Chakshu' platform within the 30-day window.

- **Documentation**:

  - Created a checklist for cybercrime reporting:
    1. Record incident details (type, date, time, description).
    2. Collect evidence using Snagit, Camtasia, or FTK Imager.
    3. Identify the appropriate platform (e.g., National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, Chakshu).
    4. Submit a detailed report with evidence.
    5. Track and follow up on the complaint.
  - Noted observations on platform usability and evidence collection efficiency.

- **Observations**:
  - **Evidence Collection**: Snagit and Camtasia were user-friendly for capturing visual evidence, while FTK Imager required technical expertise for forensic imaging.
