- Analyze password strength and common vulnerabilities
- Develop insights into implementing stronger authentication mechanisms

**3. Theory**

**Password Cracking Techniques**

Password cracking involves attempting to discover or bypass authentication credentials through various methodologies. These techniques exploit weaknesses in password design, storage, or user behavior to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts. Understanding these methods is essential for assessing password security and developing stronger defenses against unauthorized access.

**Types of Password Cracking Methods**

1. **Brute Force Attack**
   - Systematically attempts all possible combinations of characters to guess a password
   - Time-consuming, as it tries every permutation within a defined character set (e.g., letters, numbers, symbols)
   - Effectiveness depends on password length and complexity; longer and more varied passwords take exponentially longer to crack
   - Example: A 4-digit PIN has 10,000 possible combinations (0000â€“9999), while an 8-character password with mixed case, numbers, and symbols has trillions of possibilities
   - Commonly used when other methods fail, but requires significant computational resources
2. **Dictionary Attack**
   - Uses pre-compiled lists of common passwords, words, or phrases (e.g., "password," "qwerty," "letmein")
   - Exploits the human tendency to choose predictable, easy-to-remember passwords
   - Much faster than brute force, as it only tests a limited set of likely candidates
   - Wordlists can be customized to include context-specific terms, such as names, dates, or organization-related words
   - Ineffective against random or complex passwords not found in the wordlist
3. **Hybrid Attacks**
   - Combines dictionary words with modifications to account for common password complexity requirements
   - Adds numbers, symbols, or case variations to dictionary words (e.g., "password" becomes "Password123!" or "p@ssw0rd")
   - Balances the speed of dictionary attacks with the flexibility to crack more complex passwords
   - Often used when passwords follow predictable patterns, such as appending a year or special character
   - Example: A hybrid attack might try "john2023," "john!23," or "JohnDoe$1" based on the base word "john"

**Tools Overview**

1. **John the Ripper**
   - Open-source password cracking tool widely used in security testing
   - Supports multiple password hash formats, including MD5, SHA-1, and NTLM
   - Capable of performing dictionary, brute force, and hybrid attacks
   - Highly customizable, with options to define character sets, rules, and wordlists
   - Runs on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS) and supports parallel processing for faster cracking
2. **Hydra**
   - Network logon cracker designed for testing online authentication systems
   - Supports numerous protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, SSH, TELNET, and SMB
   - Performs rapid password guessing by testing multiple credentials in parallel
   - Useful for assessing the security of network services and web applications
   - Requires careful configuration to avoid locking out legitimate users during testing

**Ethical Considerations**

- Password cracking must only be performed on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Unauthorized cracking is illegal and can result in severe legal consequences
- Always obtain written consent from system owners before conducting security assessments
- Use findings to improve security, not to exploit vulnerabilities
- Adhere to ethical guidelines and respect privacy and data protection laws

**3. Experimental Commands:**

#### John the Ripper:

```shell
sudo apt install john
```

```shell
sudo apt install libssl-dev libcrypto++-dev
```

```shell
echo "user1:5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99" > hashes.txt
echo "user2: e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03" > hashes.txt
```

```shell
sudo apt install hashcat
```

```shell
john --format=Raw-MD5 --wordfile=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --fork=2 hashes.txt
```

**5. Learning Outcomes**

_After completing this experiment, students will:_

- Understand password cracking methodologies
- Recognize common password vulnerabilities
- Develop skills in using professional security assessment tools
- Appreciate the importance of complex password design

**6. Conclusion**

Password security is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. This experiment demonstrates the ease with which weak passwords can be compromised, emphasizing the need for:

- Complex, unique passwords
- Multi-factor authentication
- Regular password rotation
- Advanced authentication mechanisms
